how should words longer than row width be handled?
for now - assume they should be put as is.

how should separate words be derived from the string?
let's use String.Split(" ") for now. 
but the result of Split() isn't guaranteed to be as we want it.
We could just ignore unwanted empty strings.
solwed using String.Split(separators, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
